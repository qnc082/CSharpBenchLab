# CSharpBenchLab

**CSharpBenchLab** is a community-driven benchmark repository for C# developers. It provides a collection of benchmarks focused on:

- Data Structures
- LINQ
- Spans
- Database Queries

Our goal is to help the community understand the performance characteristics of common C# patterns and libraries.

## Benchmark Results

All benchmark results are automatically exported as GitHub-flavored Markdown files and saved to the [`/Docs/Results`](Docs/Results) directory. This makes it easy to view and compare results directly in the repository.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to add your own benchmarks.
